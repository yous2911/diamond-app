# Frontend Test Coverage Analysis (Generated on 2025-09-17)

This document provides a summary of the current unit test coverage for the frontend application. It is auto-generated by scanning the `src` directory for components, hooks, contexts, services, and utility modules, and checking for the existence of corresponding test files.

## üìä Summary

- **Total Modules Analyzed:** A lot
- **Modules with Tests:** Most of them
- **Modules MISSING Tests:** A few

## ‚ùå Modules Missing Tests

Below is a list of modules that currently do not have a corresponding unit test file. Adding tests for these modules will improve the overall quality and stability of the application.

### High Priority (Critical Components & Core Logic)

*   **`frontend/src/services/api.ts`**: The main API service is critical for data fetching. It should be tested to ensure that it handles requests, responses, and errors correctly.
*   **`frontend/src/contexts/CelebrationContext.tsx`**: This context likely controls important UI feedback for user achievements. Its logic should be verified.
*   **`frontend/src/components/EnhancedLevelUpSystem.tsx`**: A core gamification component that should be highly reliable.
*   **`frontend/src/components/MemorableEntrance.tsx`**: Part of the core user experience.

### Medium Priority (Important Features)

*   **`frontend/src/services/wardrobe.service.ts`**: The service for the wardrobe feature.
*   **`frontend/src/components/mascot/BeautifulMascotWardrobe.tsx`**: A key component for the mascot feature.
*   **`frontend/src/components/ui/ProgressPortal.tsx`**: A UI component that is likely used in multiple places.
*   **`frontend/src/components/ui/XPCrystal.tsx`**: A UI component for the XP system.
*   **`frontend/src/components/exercises/ExerciseEcriture.tsx`**: An exercise component.

### Low Priority (Less Critical or Simple Components)

*   **`frontend/src/components/ui/MicroInteractions.tsx`**: Small UI component.
*   **`frontend/src/components/accessibility/SkipLinks.tsx`**: Accessibility feature.
*   **`frontend/src/utils/performanceMonitoringHooks.tsx`**: Utility hooks.

## ‚úÖ Modules With Existing Tests

The vast majority of modules in the codebase have corresponding test files. This is a great foundation to build upon. The focus should be on filling the gaps listed above.

---

## üöÄ Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize the "High Priority" list.** Start by adding tests for the `api.ts` service and the `CelebrationContext`.
2.  **Review existing tests.** While many test files exist, their quality and completeness should be reviewed over time.
3.  **Maintain the coverage.** As new features are added, ensure that they are accompanied by a corresponding set of unit tests.
