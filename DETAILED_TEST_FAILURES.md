## üìä Failed Test Suites Breakdown

### 1. **HomePage.test.tsx** - 7 failing tests
**Issues:** Multiple elements with same text, missing elements

#### ‚ùå `should render diamond interface with student data`
```
TestingLibraryElementError: Found multiple elements with the text: Student: Emma

Here are the matching elements:
<div>Student: Emma</div>
<span>Student: Emma</span>

Problem: Both XPCrystalsPremium and DiamondInterface show "Student: Emma"
Fix: Use specific selectors like getByTestId('diamond-interface').toHaveTextContent('Student: Emma')
```

#### ‚ùå `should handle subject click with exercises`
```
Error: Expected mockNavigate to have been called with ["/exercise", {"state": {...}}]
but it was called with ["/exercise", {"replace": false, "state": {...}}]

Problem: Navigation mock expects specific call signature
Fix: Update mock expectation to match actual navigate call
```

#### ‚ùå `should handle subject click without exercises`
```
Error: Expected mockNavigate to have been called with ["/exercise", {"state": {...}}]
but it was called with ["/exercise", {"replace": false, "state": {...}}]

Problem: Same navigation mock issue
Fix: Update mock expectation
```

#### ‚ùå `should start session when no active session exists`
```
Error: Expected mockNavigate to have been called with ["/exercise", {"state": {...}}]
but it was called with ["/exercise", {"replace": false, "state": {...}}]

Problem: Same navigation mock issue
Fix: Update mock expectation
```

#### ‚ùå `should show active session indicator when session exists`
```
TestingLibraryElementError: Unable to find an element with the text: Session Active

Problem: Component doesn't render session indicator
Fix: Add session indicator UI or update test expectation
```

#### ‚ùå `should handle missing student data gracefully`
```
TestingLibraryElementError: Unable to find an element with the text: Loading...

Problem: Component doesn't show loading state for missing data
Fix: Add loading state or update test
```

#### ‚ùå `should use mock subject data when API data is empty`
```
TestingLibraryElementError: Unable to find an element with the text: Mock Math

Problem: Mock subject data not rendered when API is empty
Fix: Implement fallback subject data or update test
```

#### ‚ùå `should handle logout with active session and error`
```
Error: Expected console.error to have been called with ["Logout error:", [Error]]

Problem: Console.error mock not properly configured
Fix: Setup console.error mock correctly
```

#### ‚ùå `should pass correct props to child components`
```
Error: expect(received).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.objectContaining({"student": {...}}))

Problem: Child component props don't match expected format
Fix: Verify prop passing between components
```

### 2. **LeaderboardPage.test.tsx** - 9 failing tests
**Issues:** Missing leaderboard UI elements, buttons, and ranking display

#### ‚ùå `should switch between different leaderboard categories`
```
TestingLibraryElementError: Unable to find an element with the text: Classement Global

Problem: Component only renders user-centric leaderboard, not full leaderboard UI
Fix: Implement full leaderboard with category switching or update tests
```

#### ‚ùå `should switch to weekly leaderboard`
```
TestingLibraryElementError: Unable to find an accessible element with the role "button" and name `/semaine/i`

Problem: No weekly/monthly category buttons in UI
Fix: Add category filter buttons
```

#### ‚ùå `should show different data for different categories`
```
TestingLibraryElementError: Unable to find an element with the text: 2,500 XP

Problem: UI shows "points" not "XP", different data format
Fix: Align test expectations with actual UI data format
```

#### ‚ùå `should show correct rank numbers`
```
TestingLibraryElementError: Unable to find an element with the text: 1er

Problem: UI shows "#2" format, not "1er", "2√®me" French ordinals
Fix: Either implement French ordinals or update test expectations
```

#### ‚ùå `should highlight current user in the list`
```
TestingLibraryElementError: Unable to find an element with the text: Emma Martin

Problem: Text is broken up in UI, test needs flexible matcher
Fix: Use more flexible text matching
```

#### ‚ùå `should show rank change indicators`
```
TestingLibraryElementError: Unable to find an element with the text: +2

Problem: No rank change indicators implemented
Fix: Add rank change UI elements (+/-N indicators)
```

#### ‚ùå `should display appropriate icons for top positions`
```
TestingLibraryElementError: Unable to find an element by: [data-testid="crown-icon"]

Problem: No crown/medal icons for top positions
Fix: Add ranking icons for top 3 positions
```

#### ‚ùå `should show player details when player is clicked`
```
TestingLibraryElementError: Unable to find an element with the text: Lucas Dubois

Problem: Player rows not clickable or text matching issue
Fix: Make player rows clickable and add player detail modal
```

#### ‚ùå `should close player details when close button is clicked`
```
TestingLibraryElementError: Unable to find an element with the text: Lucas Dubois

Problem: Same as above - no player detail interaction
Fix: Implement player detail modal system
```

### 3. **CelebrationSystem.test.tsx** - 12 failing tests
**Issues:** Component not rendering celebration text, act() warnings

#### ‚ùå All celebration tests failing with:
```
TestingLibraryElementError: Unable to find an element with the text: Excellent travail !

Ignored nodes: comments, script, style
<body><div /></body>

Problem: CelebrationSystem component not rendering any content
Fix: Fix component implementation to actually render celebration messages
```

#### ‚ùå `act()` warnings:
```
Warning: An update to CelebrationSystem inside a test was not wrapped in act(...)

Problem: State updates in useEffect not wrapped in act()
Fix: Wrap async state updates in act() or use proper async testing
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The CelebrationSystem component appears to be completely broken - it renders an empty div. The component logic for displaying celebration messages is not working.

### 4. **ParentDashboard.test.tsx** - Multiple failures
**Issues:** API fetch errors, missing dashboard elements

#### ‚ùå Various dashboard tests:
```
Error fetching children data: Error: Failed to fetch

Problem: Mock API not properly configured for parent dashboard
Fix: Setup proper fetch mocks for parent dashboard API calls
```

### 5. **ExercisePage.test.tsx** - Exercise interaction failures
**Issues:** Missing exercise UI elements and interactions

---

### 6. **Other Component Tests** - Various issues
**Issues:** Props, mocking, component structure mismatches

## üîß Priority Fix List

### üî¥ **CRITICAL (Fix First)**

1. **CelebrationSystem.test.tsx** - Component completely broken
   - Fix: Component not rendering any content whatsoever
   - Impact: 12 failing tests

2. **HomePage.test.tsx** - Multiple text elements
   - Fix: Use specific test-ids instead of text matching
   - Impact: 7 failing tests

3. **LeaderboardPage.test.tsx** - Missing entire UI
   - Fix: Implement full leaderboard UI or drastically simplify tests
   - Impact: 9 failing tests

### üü° **MEDIUM**

4. **Navigation mocks** - Consistent issue across multiple files
   - Fix: Update all navigation mock expectations to include `replace: false`

5. **API fetch mocks** - Multiple components affected
   - Fix: Setup comprehensive fetch mocking strategy

### üü¢ **LOW**

6. **Minor prop passing issues** - Small component interface mismatches

## üõ† Specific Code Fixes Needed

### CelebrationSystem Component
```typescript
// Current: Component renders nothing
// Need: Actual celebration message rendering

// Fix in CelebrationSystem.tsx:
return (
  <div>
    {phase === 'celebrate' && (
      <div>Excellent travail !</div>
    )}
    {/* Other celebration content */}
  </div>
);
```

### HomePage Navigation Mocks
```typescript
// Update all tests with:
expect(mockNavigate).toHaveBeenCalledWith('/exercise', {
  replace: false,  // Add this
  state: expect.objectContaining({...})
});
```

### LeaderboardPage Options
**Option 1:** Implement full UI
**Option 2:** Simplify tests to match current user-centric implementation

---

## üìà Expected Impact

Fixing these issues should achieve:
- **CelebrationSystem:** +12 passing tests
- **HomePage:** +7 passing tests
- **LeaderboardPage:** +9 passing tests
- **Navigation fixes:** +5-10 passing tests

**Total estimated improvement:** +33-38 passing tests
**Target pass rate:** ~87-90% (from current 74.2%)
