-- By grade level
SELECT SUBSTRING(competence_code, 1, 2) as grade, COUNT(*) 
FROM exercises GROUP BY SUBSTRING(competence_code, 1, 2);

-- By subject
SELECT 
  CASE WHEN competence_code LIKE '%.FR.%' THEN 'FRANCAIS'
       WHEN competence_code LIKE '%.MA.%' THEN 'MATHEMATIQUES'
  END as subject, COUNT(*) 
FROM exercises GROUP BY subject;
